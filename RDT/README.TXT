# RDT - resident program library

This library tranforms an ordinary program into a TSR with reasonable
safety, full context switching, hotkey support and a multiplex service.

The initial version was developed using Borland C++ 3.1, but the basic
architecture should be portable to most 16-bit DOS compilers.

Currently requires the COMPACT or HUGE memory model.
