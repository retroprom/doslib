## DOS library experiments

This is a set of hobby experiments in DOS programming. They might be of some interest to people doing retrocomputing on the PC platform.

### Context

My hacker career started in the 90s. I was a (young) guy with a PC. Mine was a 486/DX2 running Windows 95 built by a long-forgotten company called ESCOM.

Programming was a thing for experts back then. Development tools were expensive and information was scarce. Microsoft platforms had an open culture, but only to those with lots of money and experience. The rest of us only got shareware and ready-made binary applications.

Today however we can have it all. Development tools are available for free online, and in addition to that we have the Internet as an information ressource. Using this any programmer can now be the "guru" that gets to write DOS games and applications.

At some point I simply wanted to try what it would have been like, and so I got myself an HP 200LX and some Toshiba Libretto 100CT and started hacking. This project is one of the results.
